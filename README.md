# Scripture Shuffle: Random Verse Challenge 
This fully functional Django application empowers your users to embark on a multiple-choice quiz featuring your personally curated selection of Bible verses sourced from the King James Version (KJV). With every quiz, participants encounter a fresh array of randomly selected verses, ensuring each Bible challenge remains uniquely engaging and enriching. 

The only other requirement besides Django is to install the pythonbible package: 

pip install pythonbible
